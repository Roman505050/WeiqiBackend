# Branch Naming Conventions

Branch names play a crucial role in managing the development workflow of a project. By following consistent naming conventions, you can easily identify the purpose and scope of each branch, making it easier to track changes and collaborate effectively with other contributors.

This document outlines the branch naming conventions that should be followed when creating new branches in the repository. These conventions help maintain a structured and organized codebase, ensuring that all changes are made in a consistent and predictable manner.

## Branch Types

Branch names should be **descriptive** and follow these conventions:

:::note
- `feature/<feature-name>` - For **new features**.
- `bugfix/<bug-name>` - For **bug fixes**.
- `hotfix/<hotfix-name>` - For **critical fixes**.
- `docs/<docs-name>` - For **documentation updates**.
- `refactor/<refactor-name>` - For **code refactoring**.
- `enhancement/<enhancement-name>` - For **enhancements**.
:::

## Naming Guidelines

When naming branches, consider the following guidelines:

- Use **lowercase** for all branch names.
- **Separate words with hyphens** (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).
- Avoid using special characters or spaces.
- Keep branch names **short**, but descriptive enough to understand the purpose.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can create a consistent and structured naming scheme for branches in the repository, making it easier to manage and track changes effectively.

## Examples

Here are some examples of branch names following the naming conventions:

:::tip
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/error-handling`
- `hotfix/security-patch`
- `docs/contributing-guide`
- `refactor/code-optimization`
- `enhancement/performance-improvements`
:::

By using descriptive branch names, you can quickly identify the purpose of each branch and understand the changes being made, facilitating collaboration and code review processes.

## Conclusion

Branch naming conventions are an essential aspect of maintaining a structured and organized codebase. By following consistent naming guidelines, you can ensure that all branches are created and managed in a predictable and standardized manner, enhancing collaboration and productivity among contributors.
