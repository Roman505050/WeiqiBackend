# Security Guidelines

Security is a critical aspect of software development, and it is essential to follow best practices to protect users' data and prevent security vulnerabilities. This document outlines the security guidelines and best practices for writing secure code, conducting security reviews, and reporting security vulnerabilities in this project.

## **Security Best Practices**

- Follow **security best practices** when writing code to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords or API keys in the code.
- Use secure methods for handling user input, such as parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## **Security Reviews**

- Conduct **security reviews** of the codebase to identify potential security risks.
- Use **static analysis tools** to detect security vulnerabilities in the code. This project uses **mypy** for static analysis.
- Address any security issues promptly and follow best practices to mitigate risks.
- Perform regular security audits to ensure the codebase remains secure and free from vulnerabilities.

## **Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

- If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, report it immediately to the maintainers.
- Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by the project team.
- Work with the maintainers to fix the vulnerability and release a patch to protect users.
- Follow responsible disclosure practices to ensure that security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and effectively.

By following these security guidelines and best practices, you can contribute to the security and integrity of the project, protecting users' data and ensuring that the codebase remains secure and resilient to potential threats. Security is everyone's responsibility, and by working together, we can create a safer and more secure software ecosystem for all users.

## **Conclusion**

Security is a critical aspect of software development, and it is essential to prioritize security throughout the development lifecycle. By following the security guidelines and best practices outlined in this document, you can contribute to the security and integrity of the project, protect users' data, and prevent security vulnerabilities. Security is a shared responsibility, and by working together to implement secure coding practices, conduct security reviews, and address security vulnerabilities promptly, we can create a safer and more secure software ecosystem for all users.
